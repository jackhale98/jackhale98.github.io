## Welcome!

This is my first blog post. I'm using Hugo with the PaperMod theme to create a beautiful, fast blog.

### Features

The PaperMod theme includes:

- Dark mode support
- Fast performance
- Clean, minimal design
- Responsive layout

### Getting Started

To create more posts, use:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```
